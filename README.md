- my first CTF for OWLSEC, shouldn't be to hard. beginner friendly :)
- worse part about CTFs that i've learned and experianced are rabbit holes... never want to go down one of those, just need to find the right path to finish this OWLSEC ctf or maybe sometimes the answer is right infront of you.

- Also another cool fact i've learned so far while learning cybersecurity & pentesting during self teaching or in the owlsec discord is that password lists are good for brute forcing especially if it's a custom social engineered password list. but nowadays bruteforcing is becoming (remember humans are the weakest link in security chains)
- harder to accomplish and is not how it use to be in th past. Hopefully this can help me become part of the "owlsec" team. 
- owlsec for life <3

 
- remember if you get stuck at any point, just take a break and come back to it later. that usually helps.
