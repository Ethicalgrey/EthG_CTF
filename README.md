# EthG_CTF
# OwlSec
my first CTF for OWLSEC, shouldn't be to hard. beginner friendly :)
worse part about CTFs that i've learned and experianced are rabbit holes... never want to go down one of those, just need to find the right path to finish this OWLSEC ctf.
remember if you get stuck at any point, just take a break and come back to it later. that usually helps.
